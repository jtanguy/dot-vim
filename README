Configuration files for vim
===========================

## Install

Provided this repository is located in your ~/.vim folder, you must symlink two things.

First: symlink the `autoload` directory in the pathogen subdir to the top-level `~/.vim`.

~~~~
ln -s ~<username>/.vim/bundle/pathogen/autoload ~<username>/.vim/autoload
~~~~

Your `~/.vim` directory should look like this:
~~~~
README
autoload -> bundle/pathogen/autoload
bundle
vimrc
~~~~
